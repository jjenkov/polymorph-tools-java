# Polymorph Fabric - Java Implementations
Java implementations of technology ideas from my Polymorph project. This project contains only the
non-GUI implementations. Everything directly related to GUI will be located in another repository.

- Polymorph Data Encoding (PDE) reader and writer implementations
- Polymorph Data Language (PDL) parser implementation


## Polymorph Data Encoding and Polymorph Data Language Specifications
The Polymorph Data Encoding (PDE) and Polymorph Data Language (PDL) specifications can be found in
this GitHub repository:


[PDE and PDL Specifications](https://github.com/jjenkov/pde-pdl-specification)


## Polymorph Data Encoding Writer and Reader

You can see an example of how to write raw, binary PDE in the PdeWriterTest, here:


[PdeWriterTest](https://github.com/jjenkov/polymorph-fabric-java/blob/main/src/test/java/com/plmph/pde/PdeWriterTest.java)


You can see an example of how to read raw, binary PDE in the PdeReaderTest, here:

## Contributions
If you want to contribute to the Polymorph project - great! There are multiple ways to contribute:

 - Usage + feedback
 - Spread awareness
 - Contributions to standards and code

The best way to contribute is to use the Polymorph technologies and provide feedback and suggestions.

Another good way to contribute is to spread the awareness of the Polymorph technologies via blog posts,
social media posts, videos, conference talks, to your colleagues and friends etc.

The last way to contribute to the project is to contribute to the standards and code. 
While the standards are open and several of the implementations are open source, 
there are some restrictions on contributions. These restrictions are:

1) Unsolicited commits (Pull Requests (PRs)) will (most likely) be rejected. 
2) Coordinate with the project first, then make suggestions, and if accepted - an issue will be opened.
3) A suggestion should be aligned with the overall vision and goals for the project. Feature suggestions must be broadly beneficial - not just beneficial to you. 
4) Once an issue is opened - agreement has to be reached about who submits a commit for that issue. If you have not reached agreement that you will be providing that commit - a commit from you will get rejected. 
5) A commit (PR) can only address one issue. Do not mix multiple issues into the same commit. You will be asked to split them.
6) Do NOT change the formatting of any files. Do NOT use your IDE's default formatting. Follow the formatting conventions of the project.

So far, there is no way to contribute financially. Maybe sometime in the future that will be possible.
